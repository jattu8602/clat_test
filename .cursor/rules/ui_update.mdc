Build an admin UI for managing test questions where the question flow follows a fixed subject order:
English → GK → Legal Reasoning → Logical Reasoning → Quantitative Techniques.

Requirements:
Question Entry Order – The admin adds all English questions first, then GK, then Legal Reasoning, and so on, in the given subject order.
Subject Skipping – The admin can skip any subject entirely if no questions are to be added for it.
Editing – The admin can edit or update any question at any time.
Numbering Logic – Questions are numbered in increasing order regardless of subject. Example:

English: Q1–Q10
GK: Q11–Q13
Legal Reasoning: No questions added
Logical Reasoning: Q14–Q33
Quantitative Techniques: No questions added

UI Ideas:

A top navigation bar showing all subjects in order, along with the range of question numbers for each subject (e.g., “English (1–10)”).

Easy navigation between subjects.

Option to add, view, or edit questions directly from the top nav.

Clearly mark skipped subjects.

Highlight the currently active subject section.

Goal: Create an intuitive, responsive admin interface that allows easy question management while clearly reflecting the subject order and numbering.
