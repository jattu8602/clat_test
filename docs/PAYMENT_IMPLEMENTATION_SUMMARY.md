# Payment System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The payment system has been successfully implemented for the CLAT Prep application with both admin and user interfaces, Razorpay integration, and comprehensive payment management.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- **PaymentPlan Model**: Enhanced with new fields for better plan management
  - `durationType`: Supports days, months, years, or until specific date
  - `untilDate`: For time-based plans (e.g., until exam date)
  - `thumbnailUrl`: For plan images
  - `description`: Detailed plan description
  - `discount`: Percentage discount (0-100)
  - `isActive`: Plan availability status

### 2. Admin Payment Management (`/admin/payment-history`)

- **Create Payment Plans**:

  - Plan name, price, duration, and type

  - Plan description and active status
  - Support for time-based plans (until specific date)

- **Edit Payment Plans**:

  - Modify all plan details
  - Real-time discount calculation
  - Duration type switching

- **Delete Payment Plans**:

  - Safe deletion (prevents deletion of plans with existing payments)
  - Confirmation dialogs

- **Plan Display**:
  - Grid layout with plan cards
  - Visual indicators for active/inactive plans
  - Discount badges and final price calculation

### 3. User Payment Interface (`/dashboard/payment-history`)
