Passage I
The evening his master died he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in the few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch-long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. He worked the dirt around in his mouth and swallowed, leaning his head back and opening his eyes in time to see the strip of sun fade to dark blue and then to nothing. He was the only man in the realm, slave or free, who ate dirt, but while the bondage women, particularly the pregnant ones, ate it for some incomprehensible need, for that something that ash cakes and apples and fatback did not give their bodies, he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because the eating of it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life. This was July, and July dirt tasted even more like sweetened metal than the dirt of June or May.
 Something in the growing crops unleashed a metallic life that only began to dissipate in mid-August, and by harvest time that life would be gone altogether, replaced by a sour moldiness he associated with the coming of fall and winter, the end of a relationship he had begun with the first taste of dirt back in March, before the first hard spring rain. Now, with the sun gone and no moon and the darkness having taken a nice hold of him, he walked to the end of the row, holding the mule by the tail. In the clearing he dropped the tail and moved around the mule toward the barn.

PASSAGE – II

The demise of Fali S. Nariman, constitutional scholar and lawyer, at the age of 95 last week turned out to be an occasion for many observers of Indian politics to reflect upon the state of constitutional democracy in the country. A line in his autobiography was particularly the point of discussion in many tributes: “I have lived and flourished in a secular India. In the fullness of time, if God wills, I would also like to die in a secular India.” The turmoil of our present is perceived through two views of our past. The first is reflected in the quote cited above by Nariman. This notion suggests that India flourished as a secular nation, and people of different faiths coexisted happily. This peaceful coexistence was disrupted by the rise of Hindu nationalism, which marked some major milestones by destroying the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in 1992, and inaugurating a Ram temple at that exact location in 2024. The secular, ideal India that existed earlier is facing an existential threat, and this is the anxiety that is expressed in Nariman’s thought. The present is understood as a progressive calamity that is dismantling our comforting past, in this view. The other view of the present is that the current regime is setting the course of history right. India’s past is of Hindu pride and achievement, but secular politics ignored it. So, in this understanding of our past, there was an undefined past when everything was great, and that Ram Rajya is being restored, after dismantling the immediate past of secular deviance and corruption. Both views agree on the point that the immediate past of India, roughly from the point of the constitution of the modern Indian republic to 2014, when Narendra Modi came to power, is being dismantled. A monolithic notion of a pristine past is an essential ingredient of all politics of the present. What did not exist is often invented, and what is often called tradition and assumed as eternally present is often of recent origins, as Eric Hobsbawm demonstrates. The glory of our past invoked by Hindutva is often beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals, and accessible only to the clairvoyant ones. But the glory of our recent past, recorded in languages that we still use, can be examined within the familiar framework of reason.

PASSAGE – IV

A trove of 22 looted Japanese artifacts, found in a family’s Massachusetts attic, has returned home after nearly 80 years. According to an FBI statement, the family discovered the artifacts while sorting through items in their late father’s house. The father was a World War II veteran but did not serve in the Pacific Theater. When the family researched the artifacts, they learned that several were in the FBI’s National Stolen Art File. The items were from the Ryukyu Kingdom, which ruled Okinawa between the 15th and 19th centuries, and they had been taken during the Battle of Okinawa during World War II. After the discovery, the family notified the FBI, which began investigating the case. Very few items survived from that kingdom. Recouping heritage, recouping cultural treasures, and knowledge of their own history is a really big deal for a lot of people in Okinawa. The trove included six painted scrolls from the 18th and 19th centuries, a hand-drawn map of Okinawa from the 19th century and other pottery and ceramic items. The FBI sent the artifacts to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, D.C., where experts unrolled the scrolls, revealing brightly colored portraits of Okinawan royalty, and verified their authenticity.  It’s an exciting moment when you watch the scroll unfurl in front of you. You witness history, and you witness something that hasn’t been seen by many people in a very long time. The Battle of Okinawa was among the bloodiest in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Fought in the spring of 1945, the battle killed roughly 12,000 Americans, 110,000 Japanese soldiers and conscripts and 100,000 Japanese civilians. Alongside the artifacts, the family discovered a typed letter from a soldier stationed in the Pacific that explained what happened to the items in the battle’s aftermath. According to the Times, the letter’s author described a failed attempt to sell the items to a museum in the United. States after smuggling them out of Japan. A nation’s cultural identity is really summed up in the artifacts and the history. This is what makes a culture. And without it, you’re taking away their history. And the surest way to eliminate a culture is to eliminate their past. The “official handover” took place last week, and the artifacts are now safely home in Okinawa. According to the statement, the FBI’s Art Crime Program has recovered more than 20,000 items with an estimated value of over $900 million. Even so, officials note that several Okinawan artifacts are still missing, and tips from the public are often a key step in the recovery process.

PASSAGE – V

You’re home at night, when suddenly the sub-bass boom of a thunderclap splits the atmosphere in two. You rush to your window as rain begins to cascade down from the darkness above, and trees tremble and bend in the billowing wind. Water hammers against the glass, a flash of lightning illuminates the world in a blinding whiteness, before another eardrum-shattering cacophony of sound accompanies the plunge into a deeper darkness. Safe inside your warm home, you look out upon the immensity and power of the storm with a kind of excited, terrified glee. It’s the same sort of feeling you might have when looking out at a raging  ocean, or standing at the foot of an enormous waterfall, or when, high in mist-filled mountains, you glimpse yet higher peaks towering above you, disappearing beyond the clouds. If you’ve ever felt the delightful mix of exhilaration, awe, and fear such moments produce, then you’ve experienced the sublime. The sublime for Burke is an aesthetic experience that occurs when we encounter phenomena that, due to their immensity or raw power, overwhelm and astonish our senses. The passion caused by the great and sublime in nature, when those causes operate most powerfully, is astonishment; and astonishment is that state of the soul, in which all its motions are suspended, with some degree of horror. In this case the mind is so entirely filled with its object, that it cannot entertain any other, nor by consequence reason on that object which employs it. Hence arises the great power of the sublime, that, far from being produced by them, anticipates our reasonings, and hurries us on by an irresistible force. Astonishment, as I have said, is the effect of the sublime in its highest degree; the inferior effects are admiration, reverence, and respect. The sublime can rouse our “strongest passion”, holding a transformative power that distinguishes it from mere beauty. Beauty typically involves small, delicate, pleasure-inducing phenomena — an orchid, a curved China pot. The sublime, by contrast, arises from things vast, powerful, threatening — things that could do us real harm. Crucially, however, while it involves dangerous things, the sublime “should have no idea of danger connected with it.” In other words, there should be no imminent danger to us — the thrill of the sublime arises when abstract terror occurs within the comfort of personal safety. So: watching the raging sea from the peace of the shoreline, rather than being thrown among the waves; feeling the relentless enormity and secrecy of the cosmos during a total eclipse, while safely inside Earth’s atmosphere; being reminded of our tiny precarious fragility, without actually having it crushed. Indeed, unlike beauty, the sublime activates something deep in us, a “violent emotion of the nerves”, stemming from a primal need for survival.
21. What is the primary effect of the sublime on the human mind according to the passage?
(a) It leads to a heightened sense of beauty and aesthetics in everyday objects.
(b) It diminishes the significance of human achievements in the face of nature's grandeur.
(c) It encourages a deep philosophical reasoning about the nature of existence.
(d) It induces a state of astonishment where normal thought processes are suspended.

22. In the context of the passage, what does the word 'sublime' imply?
(a) Tranquillity and peace found in nature.
(b) The overwhelming power and immensity of nature that astonish the senses.
(c) The inherent beauty and delicacy of natural phenomena.
(d) The dangerous aspects of nature that pose real threats to safety.

23. What concept does the passage primarily explore?
(a) The historical significance of natural disasters
(b) The psychological impact of witnessing natural beauty
(c) The techniques used in artistic representations of nature
(d) The aesthetic experience of the sublime in nature

24. Suitable Title of the passage:
(a) The Awe-Inspiring Power of the Sublime
(b) The Beauty of Nature's Fury
(c) The Dangers of Natural Phenomena
(d) The Delicacy and Pleasure of Beauty
